### Overview

Why does this repo exist?

For the following reasons

- people keep asking me for DE training resources.  
- people ask me what online courses I do.  
- people ask me what books I read.  

In my opinion, paid resources are a better use of your time than free content. On average, I find the return on time to be higher with paid resources.

This is not a comprehensive list but a curated list. A good starting point.
