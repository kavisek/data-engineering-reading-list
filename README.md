# date-engineering-reading-list

#### Why does this repo exist?

"because people keep asking me for DE training resources."

### Overview

A list of recommended books, courses, and online resources on data engineering and cloud development.

In my opinion, paid resources are a better use of your time than free content. On average, I find the return on time to be higher with paid resources.

This is not a comprehensive list but a curated list. A good starting point.
